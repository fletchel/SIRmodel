# SIRmodel

A toy SIR model I built to teach myself Mesa. Mesa is an agent based modelling library for Python.

This code allows you to visualise SIR curves as well as infection patterns in a grid using matplotlib Mesa's built-in visualisation tools respectively. You can specify a number of parameters such as infectious period, rate of infection etc. The results are pretty interesting especially for such a simple model! Hoping in the future to flesh this out a little more and do some experiments with it.
